    I am a former teacher who is excited to make the world a better place through writing quality code for a quality organization. I love to solve problems and constantly learn. While I am a beginner, I have experience making a mobile app and working on a web app. I have worked in the front end, back end, with SQL, and with frameworks. I will need mentoring, but as a mature adult, I am fully able to deal with individual responsibility. Oh, and by the way, I am all about working hard.

   This is a mobile app built for the <a href="http://replayfx.org/" target="_blank">ReplayFX Convention</a> that will take place this summer at the Pittsburgh Convention Center on July 27-30, 2017. Last year the convention was attended by 10,000 people. This convention is about gaming and is the home of the Pinburgh Championships with prize money of $100,000. The convention center will be filled with pinball and arcade games on free play, as well as many other activities.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In addition to being a scheduling app, it lists the arcade and pinball games. It displays the entire schedule organized by date and time. It also displays the schedule filtered by the type of event, such as competition, music, movie, etc. Another feature of the app is that it allows users to select "favorites" among the events to add them to their own schedule of favorites. Right now I am adding a feature which will display alerts when favorited events are coming up.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The app is currently available in private Beta for Android and iPhone.</p>

   This is a fun game which allows players to match the faces of the <a href="http://www.academypgh.com/" target="_blank">Academy Pittsburgh</a> Session Two students in order to win an on-screen reward. I built it with my classmate, <a href="http://craydigitalspace.com/" target="_blank">Cray.</a> This game gave us a chance to integrate and extend our knowledge of html, css, and javascript. We were able to take great advantage of Jquery by manipulating classes to display our squares, remove the squares, and display the "reward." We also had a lot of fun using arrays and Javascript's push and pop methods. I have loved working on teams with people.

  This was a very good, practical experience for me to add features to a codebase, which is primarily what a developer would be doing as an employee.  I added a couple of tables to an existing database. There already was an MVC framework for tables related to the events that will be occuring during the Replay FX Convention. I added the ability to CRUD for the Games feature by building tables, making controllers, and designing views. These allow the folks at Replay to create a database of their games to be sent to an API. The Replay people can then use these games in their website and we can use them in our app for the convention.

                          <h4> Ruby Console Version of Conway's Game of Life</h4>
                          </br>
                          </br>
                           <p>
  This simple, console version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway's Game of Life</a> was one of my first coding 'ah-ha' moments. Once I read the four rules and realized there were only really two rules that needed to be followed, I immediately could envision how one could create and loop through arrays to check for neighboring 'alive' and 'dead' cells. Of course getting ideas into the syntax a computer needs for its understanding is always difficult, and in this case using a two dimensional array was frustrating at first. The real challenge came when thinking about edge cases. In this program, those cases are literally on the edge! That part was frustrating but I was able to power through by thinking about how each edge case would be defined and dealing with it individually, then realizing that there was a pattern there as well that could be checked.

   Flexable is a start up that recently completed a term at Alpha Lab. They were planning to build a custom product to help match childcare providers and parents, especially filling the need for parents who did not need full time care or regular, predicatable care. An experienced developer was using free time to help build their product. I and one other intern were brought on to help build that product as well, with me working in the front end. The CTO had already started creating the skeleton of the pages in the front end, but after I learned Vue.JS, I began adding features in the registration page, such as a pay pal button, drop down menus, and posting results of API calls. The next step was making additional pages, which I had begun to do. At that point, the founders decided that they no longer wanted a custom product, and would instead add features to their WordPress site, so the project to build the custom web app was terminated.</p>
                            </br>
                            <p>This internship was a great learning experience for me. To begin, I had to set up my own development environment on my computer. To do this I first built an Ubuntu virtual machine, which was my first time working in that OS. I had to run both the back end and front end, so had to set up a local database, SQL. I used SQL Workbench as well, so that I could update my version of the database and make sure that the API's and the code were working as expected. I also ran a Caddy file (which I used instead of NGINX) so I could use my local server to make queries from the development site. The routes file, api file, pubsub file, and webpack were all created by the CTO and needed modifications as we worked, so I got to see how all of the front end pieces were able to work together. In addition, I got to participate in lots of conversations about the backend, which was Java, and how the database queries would be executed. </p>
                            </br>
                            <p>In addition to all of the technical learning, perhaps the most valuable learning I got out of the internship had to with how often and how quickly technical products can change. It was great to work with an experienced developer and have his one on one guidance as well.</p>

    Currently I am taking a Coursera certification program in Java, but the first course was actually in Javascript, HTML, and CSS in order to familiarize students with computer science concepts. This image filter was the final assignment of the course, so I used a library of theirs to work with images and pixels. I went beyond the basic assignment by refactoring my code to use arrays and additional functions, methods which weren't taught in the online course. My next step will be to refactor my code for the 'rainbow filter' to be more modular and employ switch statements. Similar to the 'Game of Life'' I created in Ruby, the 'prison bars' image allowed me to work with patterns and formulas. That type of filter was something I made up to bring together ideas from the course and apply them in an original fashion. I was wary about using the two 'for loops' inside an if statement, but I requested guidance from a mentor (and engineer at Uber who just finished studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon University) and wondered if recursion would be a better way to perform that step. However, she was able to teach me about the overhead of the stack that is created with recursion. After using the Javascript for the course and having that conversation, I was better able to handle an API call for the Replay FX App in order to display data for the 'Games' section.

   My first experiences using an MVC framework were a bit fraught. My emotional state wasn't the best at the time -- mid November 2016, and I had trouble remembering where everything lived within all of dotnet's MVC folders and what everything did. I particularly had trouble with all of the magic that was happening. It seemed difficult to fully understand why certain things were happening and how to change them. I was very pleased when a classmate and I were able to get this version of Trello working. Because I was pairing with a classmate, we were able to talk things through and figure out answers to our questions. Working on a team has been my favorite and most successful way to accomplish tough tasks, and I really hope to be part of a tech team as an employee.

   This is a console game that allows users to enter words from a prompt, for example, "noun" or "past tense verb," and will then take those words and integrate them with text to create a funny story. This program was my first experience using regular expressions. It also allowed me to think about templating and incorporating other types of files into a program.
