    I am a former teacher who is excited to make the world a better place through writing quality code for a quality organization. I love to solve problems and constantly learn. I am currently an independent contractor with BenefitMany, an agency that builds web apps for nonprofits and small businesses. I have built a mobile app and worked in the front end, back end, with SQL, firebase, docker, and with frameworks. As a mature adult, I am fully able to deal with individual responsibility, but I love pair programming and working in teams.

                          </br>

                           <p>This is a mobile app built for the <a href="http://replayfx.org/" target="_blank">ReplayFX Convention</a> that takes place every summer at the Pittsburgh Convention Center in late July. Last year the convention was attended by 10,000 people. This convention is about gaming and is the home of the Pinburgh Championships with prize money of $100,000. The convention center will be filled with pinball and arcade games on free play, as well as many other activities.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In addition to being a scheduling app, it lists the arcade and pinball games. It also displays the schedule filtered by the type of event, such as competition, music, movie, etc. Another feature of the app is that it allows users to select "favorites" among the events to add them to their own schedule of favorites. Push Notifications fire 15 minutes before the favorited events.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The app is currently available on Google Play and the App Store.</p>

                           <p>This is a fun game which allows players to match the faces of the <a href="http://www.academypgh.com/" target="_blank">Academy Pittsburgh</a> Session Two students in order to win an on-screen reward. I built it with my classmate, <a href="http://craydigitalspace.com/" target="_blank">Cray.</a> This game gave us a chance to integrate and extend our knowledge of html, css, and javascript. We were able to take great advantage of Jquery by manipulating classes to display our squares, remove the squares, and display the "reward." We also had a lot of fun using arrays and Javascript's push and pop methods. I have loved working on teams with people.

  This was a very good, practical experience for me to add features to a codebase, which is primarily what a developer would be doing as an employee.  I added a couple of tables to an existing database. There already was an MVC framework for tables related to the events that will be occuring during the Replay FX Convention. I added the ability to CRUD for the Games feature by building tables, making controllers, and designing views. These allow the folks at Replay to create a database of their games to be sent to an API. The Replay people can then use these games in their website and we can use them in our app for the convention. I also integrated the ability to upload photo files and store them in an Azure bucket as well as a call to an external API (using XML) to populate the game properties.

                           <p>As a code challenge to be completed in 72 hours for a development position, I had to use microservices to provide a web-based user interface that lets users view ten recent tweets from one of three topics and RESTful API end points to pull from a database.</p>
                            <br> 
                            <p>I chose to use Sinatra with the Twitter gem and SQLite in development/ Postgres in production for the backend. Because of the requirement of the challenge, the tweets from Twitter have to be stored in a database. If I were <strong>really</strong> doing this project, I would just use the Twitter API in the front end. The front end is written in React, uses Bootstrap and Sass, Axios, moment, and webpack. The backend is deployed in Heroku and the front end is hosted on AWS.

    This little feature was inspired by an exercise from a Coursera program in Java, but the first course was actually in Javascript, HTML, and CSS in order to familiarize students with computer science concepts. This image filter was the final assignment of that course, so I used a library of theirs to work with images and pixels. I went beyond the basic assignment by refactoring my code to use arrays and additional functions, methods which weren't taught in the online course. My next step will be to refactor my code for the 'rainbow filter' to be more modular and employ switch statements. The 'prison bars' image allowed me to work with patterns and formulas. That type of filter was something I made up to bring together ideas from the course and apply them in an original fashion. I was wary about using the two 'for loops' inside an if statement, but I requested guidance from a mentor (and engineer at Uber who just finished studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon University) and wondered if recursion would be a better way to perform that step. However, she was able to teach me about the overhead of the stack that is created with recursion. After using the Javascript for the course and having that conversation, I was better able to handle an API call for the Replay FX App in order to display data for the 'Games' section.

                            <p>Through WorkHard Pittsburgh, I was hired as a contractor to help build this web app. I, with two others, worked on the project from October to January. We attended meetings with the customer, adjusted requirements, and built the site from the beginning. One of the three who was more experienced was the mentor and taught the other two of us the basics of what we needed to know

The front end is React and uses some libraries, such as RailsStrap, CoreUI, and react-data-grid. I contributed code to both the front end and back end.
